# Mini Blog

This small project is a website that simulates a blog. The same was done along with a react course.

## Website functions:
  - Login and user registration;
  - Creation and manipulation of your posts (Create, Edit and Delete);
  - View all posts from all users;
  - Search for posts using specific tags.

## Technologies used:
  - React;
  - React Router;
  - Hooks;
  - Context;
  - Firebase;
  - Styled Components.

## Improvement points:
  - Make the website responsive;
  - It is possible to componentize some more elements, such as Forms (creating and editing          posts), and when you do not find posts available;
  - Separate component organization for layouts.
